### Movie Site Project

The task was to create a website that lists movies from an API.

### Problems

Since we were using two different API:s it was quite difficult not to mix them up. Also I have never worked with Routing, so I hade to put a lot of effort in understanding it and using it right.

### The result
With instructions from Diego, chat GPT and help from classmates I solved it, even though it all felt like a mess from the beginning. Although if I had more itme I would like to pay more attention to the design.
